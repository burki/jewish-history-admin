Legacy back-end <https://jewish-history-online.net>
===================================================

This is the code for the back-end of the site. It is an old code base
that has been tweaked for various research projects
(<https://docupedia.de>, eJournal Kritikon) but isn't recommended for any
new project due to its age.

You may use it in parts or adjust it to your own needs.
If you have any questions or find this code helpful, please contact us at
